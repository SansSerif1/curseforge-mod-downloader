# curseforge-mod-downloader
A simple Java code made for downloading mods from modpacks, when you dont want the CurseForge App, or the MultiMC Launcher for some reason.

# Use

2) do "java -jar CFMDownloader.jar /Path/To/Extracted/CurseForge/Modpack" (Example: /Data/Modpack/AOF3 (The folder should contain manifest.json for the program to work))
3) Read README.txt in JarFolder/Downloaded/Modpack
4) Profit
5) (Optional) Create new minecraft installation, download modloader specified in README.txt and play

# License
Well, I know nothing about licenses, so as long as you credit me, you can do anything you want with the code.
